ReDressCodes
------------------

This website is supposed to contain anything interesting but because most of the people on the internet are mostly interested in Technology, Computers, Software, Games and other related topics, then you will find that this website seems to contain posts/articles in that direction.

Having just started the process of trying to revamp it, the previous website is still accessible via the same website link but with additional access to `previous.html`. In other words, the whole original website should continue to be available during the whole redesign process after and during which all the value should be moved over to the new design.
